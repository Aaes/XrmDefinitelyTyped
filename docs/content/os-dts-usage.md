Option sets
===========

Necessary entity and global option sets are automatically included when you reference an entity 
declaration file from the `typings/XRM/Entity/` folder, one of the IPage 
declaration files from the `typings/XRM/IPage/` folder, or one of the Form 
declaration files from the `typings/XRM/Form/`.
